# some lab work to avoid exam
The goal was to parse huge (4gb+) containing operations on sets (e.g. `add 5`, `delete 4`, merge set A with set B, union between sets, intersection, etc.)

I had a bet with my groupmate for 500 rubles that i will do it in 2 weeks, and i did it in one or two evenings. :D And i didn't need to go to exam, bcs i passed with this test.
